            <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">Our project assists gamers to find their favorite game on popular gaming platforms such as Steam with customizable constraints set by the user, ranging from platform, category, to genre and hardware requirements. Essentially, this is an authoritative and comprehensive query for the one game that suits you the best! As for the relations present in our project, we have tables regarding game ratings, genre, media data, support data etc. There will be many occasions for us to relate different tables.</p>
